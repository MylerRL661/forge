rogue: Hey Fjord! What's new with you?
fjord: Hey Rogue, just around town asking if anyone needs any smithing done today?
rogue: Wow, you're in a helpful mood. Well now that you mention it, I think my old iron bow is on it's last legs!
rogue: Perhaps some tempering from your forge could help bring it back to life?
fjord: I'll make no promises... but I'll see what I can do ;)
CONVO ENDED
